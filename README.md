### 'Challenges Faced'
Problems with react framework :
Things took a lot longer to do than it should have been due to lack of familiarity with react 

Account Abstraction: 
Using api calls and sdks to integrate waller took us a lot of time due to very less familiarity with jsx 

Integrating smart contract with frontend  : 
It was a difficult task for us 

IPFS integration : 
We spent an entire day on integrating IPFS 
There are problems in sdks available on thirdweb
So we used Pinata for IPFS storage

Using Firebase :
using firebase as a database to store metadata of nft (other than ipfs url of video) was a tideous task for us


### 'Learning From the hackathon'
Overall a lot of things were new for us and we couldn't do everything that we had planned to do in this hackathon
We lernt a lot about IPFS and its integration  , account abstraction and using it as smart wallets, dynamic nfts implementation and much more important things like networking with teammates
One of the first things to do next would be to gain fluency in using react framework and learning how to integrate contracts in project with ease in order to perform better in future hackathons
